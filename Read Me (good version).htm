<p><u><b><a name="About aMAZEing 3D">About aMAZEing 3D</a></b></u></p>
<p>aMAZEing 3D is a 3D maze game written in Visual Basic. It uses no DLL's or
controls written in faster languages such as C++ or assembler. Yep, this is a 3D
game in pure VB code. It doesn't even use DirectX yet! Just a bit of maths, a
few textures and a few pictureboxes - that's all there is to it! As far as I
know, this is the ONLY 3D game made in VB code that has perspective textures
available on the net. If you do see a similar game, I'd be interested to see it.
Please inform me at <a href="mailto:webmaster@VBgames.co.uk">webmaster@VBgames.co.uk</a>
if you know any cool 3D VB games. If you have any good VB games please also send
them to <a href="mailto:submitgames@VBgames.co.uk">submitgames@VBgames.co.uk</a>
and I will put it on my website ( <a href="http://www.VBgames.co.uk">www.VBgames.co.uk</a>
) for others to learn from. </p>
<p>If you have never visited my website before, please do because it has a
collection of quality VB games (some written by me) available for download with
source code. There are also a few tutorials, including one covering how I made
this game.</p>
<p>The objective in the game is to find your way through the maze. If you walk
up to and touch the wall with a large 'X' on it you have won.</p>
<p>However, I am trying to make this game into a shoot-em-up, just like the
classic Doom. This game would be really amazing if I chucked in a few baddies,
guns and ammo.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="About the author">About the author</a></u></b></p>
<p>Well, my name is Simon Price and I have been learning Visual Basic for about
5 months now. I am 16 and I am only really interested in making games and
graphical programs. I find if difficult / boring to make stuff like databases or
word processors. I have a website with both my games and other peoples at <a href="http://www.VBgames.co.uk">www.VBgames.co.uk</a>
. You can email me at <a href="mailto:SimonPrice@VBgames.co.uk">SimonPrice@VBgames.co.uk</a>

<p><u><b><a name="PC requirements">PC requirements</a></b></u></p>
<p>You people are the guinea pigs I'm afraid. I don't know how this game will
perform on other computers. What I do know is this : you do not need DirectX,
you do need the VB run time files. Your monitor must support 16 bit colours
(most do). My PC is 430Mhz and the game performs well on
my PC. If you have a fast PC then the larger levels will look stunning with no
slow-down. If you have a slow PC then you might find the game runs a little too
slow. Feel free to give feedback on this subject, because I need to know before
I finish the game how it will perform on other PC's.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="Options">Options</a></u></b></p>
<p>At the moment, collision detection in the game is quite unreliable, you often
get stuck on walls - so this option by default is left off. I recommend you keep
it that way, but I do not recommend that you try walking through the walls. If
you walk out of the level the game may stop working.</p>
<p>There are ten levels to choose from. 1 is the easiest and the smallest. It
also runs the fastest. 10 is the biggest and most difficult, and also runs the
slowest.</p>
<p>There are two styles of graphics to choose from - realistic or surreal. One
will make the walls from realistic textures such as stone, brick, rock, leather
and sandstone etc. The other option will load up walls where the textures are
bright, colourful patterns. Choose depending on your own tastes, but I think the
realistic textures look best.</p>
<p><u><b><a name="How to Play">How to Play</a></b></u></p>
<p>Use the arrow keys to walk around. Explore the 3D maze, and try to find the
wall marked with an 'X'. When you see it, go up to it and touch it, and you
should get a message telling you that the level is complete. If you want to exit
the game early, or you simply give up, press the Escape key to exit. That's
about all there is to it.</p>
<p><u><b><a name="Screen Captures">Screen Captures</a></b></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;You can press 'C' to capture the screen, and it will be saved in this
folder as 'Pic'. Alternatively, press 'Print Screen' and it will be copied to
the clipboard. Exit, open up your favourite graphics program and paste it where
you want.</p>
<p><u><b><a name="Creating your own levels">Creating your own levels</a></b></u></p>
<p>Yes, you can create your own levels with and ordinary paint program! Create a
new bitmap - it must be square, with sides of length 10 - 100 pixels (try a
small maze at first) and fill it in black. Then make a border wall with one of
the following colors:</p>
<p>White, vbCyan, vbMagenta, vbYellow, vbBlue, QBcolor(6), QBcolor(7)</p>
<p>Make sure the wall surrounds the entire level, otherwise the game will freeze
when it tries to draw an infinity on empty space where the leak is. Now draw in
more walls using the colors listed above. Each color represents a different wall
texture. Then, to finish off get the color vbGreen and paint one pixel green.
This will be where the player will start the level. Then make one pixel vbRed -
this will be where the wall with an 'X' will appear - so you shouldn't put in
right in front of the start position! Save your picture in the 'Levels' folder
and overwrite one of my levels, by naming it a number between 1 and 10. You must
save it as a bitmap ans leave the correct '.bmp' file extension. The load up the
game and select your own level! Cool huh? All the 3D, lighted, textured wizardry
was created from that tiny bitmap! </p>
<p><b><u><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></u></b></p>
<p>The major bug in this early version of the game is that it does not always
put your screen resolution back to normal. If you have to manually adjust your
monitor, you can do this my right clicking on the desktop, select 'Properties'
and then go to the 'Settings' tab where you will be able to change the screen
resolution / colours manually.
</p>
<p>The collision detection is also very dodgy at the moment. If you find any
more bugs, please email me at <a href="mailto:gamefeedback@VBgames.co.uk">gamefeedback@VBgames.co.uk</a>

conning me. I've spent a long time making this game and getting it up on mine

code out for free by giving me a fair mention in any games you make based on my
source code, and sending them to me at <a href="mailto:submitgames@VBgame.co.uk">submitgames@VBgame.co.uk</a>
so that it can be put on my website. OK?</p>
